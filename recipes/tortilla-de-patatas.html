  <ul>
    <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 large red bell pepper, sliced into rings</li>
    <li>1 fresh poblano chile pepper, sliced into rings</li>
    <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons bacon drippings</li>
    <li>6 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced</li>
    <li>8 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place potatoes in a large bowl, cover with cold water, and refrigerate for 30 minutes or so. 
      Drain, pat dry, and season with salt.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute bell pepper, poblano pepper, and onion in butter until soft. 
      Remove from pan, and set aside. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter and bacon fat in pan, 
      and fry the potatoes until crisp and medium brown. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Arrange the potatoes in a lightly-buttered, non-stick pan, preferably a deep, slope-sided skillet. 
      Arrange the onions and peppers over the potatoes, and then spread cheese over the top. In a mixing bowl, beat eggs with water, 
      parsley, and salt and pepper; pour the mixture over the potatoes. 
      Put the skillet in a larger pan with a half inch of water in it.</li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven until eggs set, about 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the tortilla, let cool, and loosen edges from the pan. 
      Put a serving plate over the skillet, and flip the tortilla over onto the plate. Cut into small pie-shape wedges. 
      Refrigerate until ready to serve; reheat if desired.</li>
    <li>EAT IT! 맛있게 드세요.~</li>
