  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A milkshake (sometimes simply called a shake) is a sweet drink made by blending milk, 
    ice cream, and flavorings or sweeteners such as butterscotch, 
    caramel sauce, chocolate syrup, fruit syrup, or whole fruit into a thick, 
    sweet, cold mixture.</p>

  <p>The saving grace for milkshakes is the protein and calcium content. 
    Since milkshakes contain ice cream and milk, which contains protein and calcium, 
    you can expect to consume a good 15% of your daily protein and one-fifth of 
    your daily calcium.</p>
